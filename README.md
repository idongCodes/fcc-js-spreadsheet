# fcc-js-spreadsheet
In building this spreadsheet, I applied functional programming by breaking code into smaller functions. I learned to parse expressions, handle cell data, and create a dynamic UI that updates with user input. The project helped me master callback functions and built in JS methods like map(), find(), includes(), parseInt(), reduce(), filter(), etc..
